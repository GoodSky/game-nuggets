SET UP VISUAL STUDIO:

This is a quick instructional on setting up Visual Studio for XNA and the game.

First, get Visual Studio Professional 2010. As students, we can all get it for free! Check it out: https://www.dreamspark.com/

Next, install the SP1 update on Visual Studio Professional 2010. This can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691

Finally install XNA. This is the most confusing part because XNA nowadays is bundled in the Windows Phone SDK 7.1, so it sounds like you are downloading some phone software... but really you're on the right track. Here is a nice tutorial about downloading, then using XNA. If you have a couple hours you should check the whole thing out! http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/tutorial/2dgame/getting_started
