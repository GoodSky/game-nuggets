This is the main repository for our code.

Even though the final copies will be stored on a server for 
distribution, we can keep the working copies on the repository.

Notes:
The front end is currently only my side of things (and will not run unless you have sql server on your computer)
The back end is runnable but only interesting if you have the front end.

I'll make more notes as we go along.

# Changelog
* 2/20/2017 - moving this into my game-nuggets repo since I can't think of anywhere else to put it. There are some good memories here.
